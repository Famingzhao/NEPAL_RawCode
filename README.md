# NEPAL

NEPAL is to calculate neuroendocrine (NE) risk score from  bulk and single-cell transcriptomics of both human and mouse prostate cancer (PCa). NEPAL has multiple built-in algorithms and NE gene sets. NEPC risk score may be used to stratify prognosis of PCa. For R package installation instructions, please refer to  https://github.com/Famingzhao/NEPAL. In this repository, we provide essential scripts from our study for sequencing data alignment, integration, and processing.
